Bank Import feature to read in bank transactions from qif files and assign them to accounts.

Features
- Read in transactions
- Store in db

- Use StimulusJS frontend

** Ruby version

2.5.1


** Database creation
: rake db:create
: rake db:schema:load

** Database initialization
: rake db:seed

** How to run the test suite
: rake

** Deployment instructions

** Re-filter

Currently to re-filter you have to do this through the rails console

To re-filter all

1. Add a new filter to;
   : db/seeds.db
2. Optionally add any new accounts to;
   : db/chart_of_accounts.csv
3. Run the seed
   : rake db:seed
4. Run
   : rails c
   : Transaction.refilter


** Look at what's in sundries

1. Use rails console
   : rails c
2. Get sundries account
   : a=Account.find_by_code(999)
3. List all debit transactions
   : a.debit_trans
4. List all credit transactions
   : a.credit_trans
5. Display it nicely in a table
   
   Sort by description and pick filters to match the most
   : tp a.debit_trans.order(:description), {:date =>{:width=>14}}, {:description =>{:width => 50}}, :amount

   Sort by amount and pick filters to match the largest amounts
   : tp a.debit_trans.order("amount_cents DESC"), {:date =>{:width=>14}}, {:description =>{:width => 50}}, :amount
